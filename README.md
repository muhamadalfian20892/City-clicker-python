# City-clicker-python

hello! ðŸ‘‹

So, City Clicker has been my *very* favorite game for ages. It's just got that addictive charm, you know?

Anyway, I've been messing around and getting curious about AI lately, and I had this idea: what if I tried to convert City Clicker into Python? Seemed like a fun challenge!

This project is the result of that experiment. It's my attempt to recreate the core fun of zoning, upgrading, and watching your little city treasury grow, all using Python and the `wxPython` library for the interface.

**What's in this version?**

*   **Zoning:** You can zone Residential (â™¥), Commercial (â™¦), and Industrial (â™£) areas, just like you'd expect. Click (well, double-click or press Enter in the lists) to zone more land!
*   **Upgrades:** There are upgrades to boost demand for your zones, increase population growth (gotta get those citizens!), raise taxes (the Mayor needs funds!), and even rename your city.
*   **News:** Get the latest scoop (and wildly inaccurate sports reports) from the *CITY Times* (or whatever you name it!).
*   **Saving/Loading:** The game *should* automatically save your progress to a `cityclicker_save.json` file when you close it and load it back up next time. No promises it won't get corrupted, but hey, it tries! ðŸ˜‰
*   **Reset:** Feeling like starting over? There's a reset button for that!

**Why?**

Honestly? Mostly because I love the original game and wanted to see if I could rebuild it in Python, partly with some help from AI tools to get the ball rolling on the conversion. It's been a learning process!

**Open Source!**

Just like the spirit of the original browser game, this Python version is totally open source. The main code is right there in `city.py`. Feel free to look at it, learn from it, maybe even improve it if you feel like it! No guarantees the code is *good*, but it's there!

**How to Play (Probably)**

1.  Make sure you have Python installed on your computer.
2.  You'll need the `wxPython` library. If you don't have it, open your terminal or command prompt and run: `pip install wxPython`
3.  Download the `city.py` file.
4.  Open your terminal/command prompt again, navigate to where you saved the file, and run: `python city.py`
5.  A window should pop up. Click around, zone stuff, buy upgrades, and see what happens!

Hope you enjoy this little Python remake!
